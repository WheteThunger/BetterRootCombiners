## Features

- Allows root combiners to accept input from any electrical source, if the player who deployed the root combiner has permission.

## Permissions

- `betterrootcombiners.use` -- Granting this permission to a player allows any root combiner they deploy to accept input from any electrical source.
  - You will need to reload the plugin after granting this permission if you want to make it apply to existing root combiners already deployed by players with this permission.

## Credits

- Yurii for bringing up the idea.
